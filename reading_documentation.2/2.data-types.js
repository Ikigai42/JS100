Seven data types that are primitives:
- Boolean | true and false.
- null | special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)
- undefined | A top-level property whose value is not defined.
- Number | An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.
- BigInt | An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.
- String | A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy".
- Symbol | A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
