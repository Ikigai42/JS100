Solution
The JavaScript pages on MDN are a valuable resource that you should reference frequently as you learn JavaScript. They provide both tutorials and a reference of JavaScript's built-in objects and their properties and methods, operators, and more. You can also find information about browser compatibility and specifications.

Discussion
Take some time to familiarize yourself with MDN; you will need to reference it often. In particular, make sure you know where the search bar is, as it is often the fastest entry point - whether you're looking for Array methods, examples of using the break statement, an explanation of first-class functions, or any other information.
